# Housing Price Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

#### This project will create a model that predicts home prices based on several criteria, such as home size, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com with the following link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadbinimran/housing-price-prediction-data. Thank you to the many parties who have helped me in completing this project.
